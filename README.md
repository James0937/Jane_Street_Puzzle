# History

## March 2024: Hooks 10
Solved and passed.
## April 2024: Robot Capture-the-Flag

## May 2024: Number Cross 4
Gave up. This problem cannot be solved manually since there are too many possibilities (cut or not, length of number) and it must use some huge number to complete this puzzle.
The figure shows my initial process when trying to solve it manually.
## June 2024: Altered States 2
Solved and passed.
## July 2024: Many Happy Returns
Gave up. I'm not a native English speaker, and this wordplay problem is quite tricky to me.
The txt file shows some idea of matching.
## August 2024: Tree-edge Triage
Solved and passed (too busy this month so I did it on the last day. All processes are on draft paper, so I don't record them).
## September 2024: Fences 2
Solved and passed.
## October 2024: Knight Moves 6
Solved and passed. Not hard DFS problem but I don't know the concept of knight moves initially lol.

Solved and passed.
